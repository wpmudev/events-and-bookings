### Promote & Manage Your Event

Create event pages complete with reservations, ticket sales, promotional video, event information, location and map. With Events+ you can also manage your next local meetup, conference or online event.

 

### The Perfect Design Fit

Events+ conforms to fit your theme’s design. No more messing about with special templates or other rubbish – just the layout you want. Use shortcodes and built-in widgets to integrate elements exactly where you want – sidebars, pages, posts – wherever.

![event-widget](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/event-widget-583x373.png)

 Events+ includes shortcodes, add-ons and widgets for more control over layouts.

**Enough options for you?**

### Event Countdown

Build anticipation for your online event with a countdown and automatically redirect users to your live stream when the timer expires. We think that’s pretty cool. And, with Events+ you can easily set recurring events. Set it once and there it is, just like clockwork. 

![e-templates-735x470](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/e-templates-735x470-583x373.jpg)

 Events+ includes e-Newsletter integration for better email followup style.

### Calendar Sharing & Notifications

Let guests add events to iCal or Google Calendar with a click. Automatically send guests updates when event information changes. Integrate with E-newsletter and use custom email templates to better represent your brand – or just to stick with your party theme.

### Save Time – Service Sync

Sharing your events on social media should be easy, so we made it that way. Create an event with Facebook Events, and Events+ will automatically post it to your site.

You can even pull events from other popular calendars with import from Google Calendar and Meetup.com.   

### Google Maps Plugin Integration

Directions have never been so fun. Share maps with style and add custom drop-pin icons. Google Maps Plugin integration lets you add a map to your event with custom icons and format control without playing around with code.

![events-map-integration](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/events-map-integration-583x373.png)

 Beautiful, custom and unique map design with both Google Maps plugin and Snazzy Map compatibility.

 

![events-login](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/events-login-583x373.png)

 Let users RSVP with their social network login.

### Simple RSVP & Social Share

Build your mailing list and make it easy for users to reserve their space with a simple email RSVP. Get attendees excited about your event. Spread the word with automated social sharing when attendees RSVP so they can let their friends know what they’re missing out on.

## Usage

**Please Note:** In order to utilize the full map integration you need to install our [Google Maps](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wordpress-google-maps-plugin/ "WordPress Google Maps Plugin - WPMU DEV") plugin.

### To Get Started:

Start by reading [Installing plugins](https://wpmudev.com/docs/using-wordpress/installing-wordpress-plugins/) section in our comprehensive [WordPress and WordPress Multisite Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/) if you are new to WordPress. Login to your admin panel for WordPress or Multisite and activate the plugin:

*   On regular WordPress installs – visit Plugins and Activate the plugin.
*   For WordPress Multisite installs – Activate it blog-by-blog (say if you wanted to make it a Pro Sites premium plugin), or visit Network Admin -> Plugins and Network Activate the plugin.

Once installed and activated, you will see a new menu item in your admin: _Events_. 

![Events menu](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-menu.png)

### Configure Your Settings

Let's get started with setting configuration. Go to _Admin > Events_. You will see the initial ‘**Getting Started**’ screen that will guide you through a 4-step setup process. 

![Events - Get Started](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Get-Started1.png)

 Click on ‘**Configure Your Settings**’ Button. You will be sent to the Settings Page. You can also get to the Settings Page from the _**Events > Settings**_ menu link.

##### Tutorial pop ups

When first going through the settings, you will also notice the step-by-step blue ‘pop up’ box that will guide you through your initial setup, as seen below: 

![Events - Tutorial popup](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Tutorial-popup.png)

 1\. The _Dismiss_ link will dismiss these messages for good. 2\. You can click the _Next_ button to proceed through the tutorial. Should you want to see those tutorial pop ups again after they're dismissed, you can go to _Events > Get Started_, click to open the _Help_ drop-down in the upper-right corner of the page, click to select the _Tutorial_ tab, then click the _Restart the Tutorial_ link.

##### Tooltips

Events+ provides lots of helpful tips by way of blue information tooltips with a white ‘**i**' inside. If you hover over these or click on it a dialogue block will appear with some helpful tips on how to complete each field, as seen below: 

![Events - Tooltips](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Tooltips.png)

 Hover your mouse over a tooltip to see a small pop-up, or click/touch the tooltip icon to display the tooltip on the page.

### Plugin Settings

Here you'll find some of the more crucial settings such as the url slug, payment and login options. 

![Events Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Settings.png)

 _Set your root slug here_ lets you specify the url slug for your event listings. Let’s assume this is a events page is for WordCamp, so we enter into the slug field ‘wordcamp-events’, your url will now be: **yourdomain.com/wordcamp-events/** Tick the _Will you be accepting payment for any of your events?_ setting in order to allow ticket sales through PayPal. Additional PayPal settings will then become available lower in the page and when creating events. The _Allow Facebook and Twitter Login?_ setting will allow you to connect with both Facebook and Twitter. _Display public RSVPs?_ lets people see who else is attending your event. Using this option, friends of those attending might sign up to make the event all that more special!

### Appearance Settings

Events+ does a great job of displaying events right out of the box, but for further customization, you can select or create additional page templates then select them for use here. Please note that if you upload your own custom templates to your theme (other than regular page templates), you effectively override the Appearance Settings of the plugin, so this section will not be available. 

![Appearance settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Appearance-settings11.png)

 The _Override default appearance?_ option lets you select from additional templates provided with Events+. These templates help provide some variation in the appearance of the plugin in the front-end. These template options are as follows: The _Archive template_ is used for lists of events, similar to how WordPress normally would list blog posts. The built-in templates are as follows:

*   **Plugin: Calendar** - A graphical calendar display of events by month
*   **Plugin: Default** - A master list of events with a sidebar for widgets
*   **Plugin: Full Width** - A list of events that spans the full page width

The _Single Event template_ is used for individual event listings, when viewing a single event. These are the built-in Single event templates:

*   **Plugin: Calendar** - A simple event display with a sidebar for widgets
*   **Plugin: Default** - Event details listed in a nice, full-width display, no sidebar
*   **Plugin: Full Width** - A full-width display of the single event details

You also have the option to select from page templates that your theme provides. And by that means, you can add your own templates by simply creating page templates within your theme.

### Payment Settings

If you checked the earlier option _Will you be accepting payment for any of your events?_, you will see the Payment Settings box after the ‘**Appearance Settings**’. Here you can configure general payment settings. 

![Payment settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-Payment-settings21.png)

 Specify the _Currency_ that will be used on your site. Here you can enter the currency you would like to accept / receive via PayPal. You can find a list of the accepted PayPal codes here: [https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_nvp_currency_codes](https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_nvp_currency_codes) And here are some codes for the most popular currencies: _GBP_ – Great British Pound _AUD_ – Australian Dollar _EUR_ – Euro _USD_ – United States Dollar You'll need to enter your _PayPal Email Address_ as well, so the system knows the account to process payments for. Simply enter the email address that is linked to your PayPal account. Ticking the _PayPal Sandbox mode?_ will use a [PayPal Sandbox test](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/sb_about-accounts/ "PayPal Sandbox test") account so you can test the payment process without actually processing live payments. You'll need to enter your Sandbox account details in the PayPal E-mail address field for this to work. Once you finish testing, you can simply deselect this option, enter your normal PayPal E-mail address and you will be ready to earn some cash! PLEASE NOTE: Events+ supports PayPal directly. For more payment options, it can be used alongside [MarketPress](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/e-commerce/ "MarketPress - WordPress e-Commerce"), which provides scores of other payment gateways as well.

### API Settings

If you checked _Allow Facebook and Twitter Login?_ earlier, you will be able to see the API Settings box, where you can configure various API settings for social services. 

![Events API Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Events-API-Settings1.png)

1.  If you intend to allow Facebook logins, enter a _Facebook App ID_ here.
2.  Ticking _My pages already load scripts from Facebook_ will keep the plugin from loading Facebook scripts. This can help to avoid conflicts with other plugins. Use this if you already have another Facebook solution loading Facebook scripts.
3.  For Twitter logins, enter your _Twitter Consumer Key_.
4.  Enter your _Twitter Consumer Secret_ as well if you are using Twitter.
5.  The _Hide login buttons_ section lets you disable any of the login methods individually. Simply untick those you don't wish to use.

For more information on how to create your Facebook and Twitter Apps, please see the below information:

##### Facebook App ID

##### Twitter Credentials

You can get a Twitter App here: [https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). Make sure you set the Callback URL in the "Settings Tab" of the App for the App to work. Set the Callback URL as the link to your site. 

![image](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Events-Plus-Plugin-V1.1-Snagit-40.png)

1.  Clear cache/cookies
2.  Create your app as instructed
3.  Go to 'Oauth tool' tab in the Twitter App and copy URI in the 'Request URI' field and paste it into the 'Callback URL' field in the 'Settings' tab

### FAQ

_When I click 'Preview' to see my Event I don't see ANYTHING on the page?  Is it broken? What's up with that?_ From the Dev: This is by design - previews do not work, as the meta fields may not get saved entirely in default AJAX requests. Good catch though! _MarketPress Integration_ Events+ offers seamless integration with our e-commerce solution, [MarketPress](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/e-commerce/). This allows the payment processing to be handled entirely by MarketPress, which supports scores of additional payment gateways and provides a cart-based solution so that users can pay for multiple event purchases all in one quick checkout process! To use Events+ with MarketPress, first activate the Payments via _MarketPress Products_ add-on in Events+. You can create a special category in MarketPress for events, and limit the selection to that category when associating an event with a MarketPress product in the new setting that appears in Events+ when the addon is activated. 

![events-marketpress-addon-settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/events-marketpress-addon-settings.png)

 You will then see an additional dropdown menu in the Event Details when you create/edit an event where you can select the MarketPress product your event should be associated with as mentioned above. Note that the product must exist in MarketPress before you can select it from the dropdown in the event editor. Your users will click the _I'm Attending_ button as usual, but will see the MarketPress _Add to Cart_ button appear instead when they do. The price that appears in the event is the price you enter in the MarketPress product. If you have the MarketPress Shopping Cart widget enabled in your sidebar, they'll see their selection appear instantly.
